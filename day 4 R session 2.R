#filter, extract only the "Amanzimtoti" data from the dataset

SACTN %>%

#and the 12th month  or (|) the first month. "month" is a function in this case that is why it is not in inverted commas

SACTN %>%
  arrange(depth, temp) # orders your data in Ascending order (lowest value to highest value)

SACTN %>%
  arrange(desc (temp)) # orders your temp in descending order

SACTN %>%

SACTN %>%

         src == "DEA", # Then specify the source
         temp <= 11 | # Temperatures at or below 11Â°C OR
           is.na(temp) # Include missing values
  )


try1<-SACTN %>%
  select(site, src, date, temp)# selected the columns that we want, thus excluding "depth" and "type"

try2<-SACTN %>%

try3<-SACTN %>%

#some examples were not done, please do..

try5<-SACTN %>%

SACTN %>%

            sd_temp = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE),    #see above same with the stadard deviation, minimum and maximum
            min_temp = min(temp, na.rm = TRUE), #good practice to always remove "NAS" in your data
